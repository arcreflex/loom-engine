# loom-engine Project Overview

This project is a TypeScript monorepo managing branching LLM conversations.
Core packages:
- `packages/engine`: The core logic (Forest, Store, Providers).
- `packages/gui`: Vite/React web UI with an Express backend server (`src/server.ts`).

**IMPORTANT:** The `engine` package is a dependency for `gui`. Changes in `engine` often require updates or verification in the others.

# Common Bash Commands (using pnpm)

- `pnpm i`: Install dependencies (run in root)
- `pnpm build`: Build all packages (essential after engine changes)
- `pnpm test`: Run tests for all packages
- `pnpm lint`: Run ESLint
- `pnpm format`: Run Prettier
- `pnpm typecheck`: Run TypeScript checks for all packages
- `pnpm -w <script>`: Run a script in the workspace root (e.g., `pnpm -w lint`)
- `pnpm --filter <package_name> <script>`: Run a script in a specific package (e.g., `pnpm --filter @ankhdt/loom-engine test`)

# GUI Specific Commands (`cd packages/gui`)

- `pnpm dev`: Start frontend (Vite) and backend (Express server) concurrently
- `pnpm dev:frontend`: Start only the Vite dev server
- `pnpm dev:backend`: Start only the backend server with `tsx watch`
- `pnpm build`: Build the GUI for production

# Code Style & Conventions

- Follow rules in `eslint.config.js` and `prettier` settings in root `package.json`.
- Use TypeScript strict mode.
- Use ES Modules (`import`/`export`).
- Prefer descriptive variable and function names.
- Add comments for complex logic, especially in the `engine`.

# Core Files & Concepts

- **Engine (`packages/engine/src`)**:
    - `engine.ts`: Main `LoomEngine` class, orchestrates generation.
    - `forest.ts`: `Forest` class, manages node tree structure (append, split, delete, paths).
    - `store/file-system-store.ts`: Default persistence layer.
    - `providers/`: LLM provider abstractions (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google).
    - `config.ts`: Handles `config.toml` loading/saving (API keys, defaults, bookmarks).
    - `types.ts`: Core data structures (Node, RootData, Message).
- **GUI (`packages/gui/src`)**:
    - `server.ts`: Express backend API exposing engine functionality.
    - `api.ts`: Frontend functions for calling the backend API.
    - `App.tsx`: Main React UI component, state management.
    - `components/`: Reusable React components.

# Testing

- Tests are located alongside source files (`*.test.ts`).
- Run tests using `pnpm test` (runs `node --test` recursively).
- Add tests for new features, especially in the `engine` package.

**IMPORTANT:**
- ALWAYS prioritize fixing the code if a test reveals an issue rather than modifying the test to pass
- Tests should drive improvements in the code, not the other way around
- If a test is failing, it's usually revealing a legitimate issue that should be fixed

# Environment

- Requires Node.js (check `engines` field if added, or specify version, e.g., >= Node 20).
- Uses `pnpm` for package management.

# Repository Etiquette

- Create feature branches (e.g., `feat/add-new-provider`).
- Ensure `pnpm lint` and `pnpm typecheck` pass before committing.

# Potential Pitfalls / Reminders

- **YOU MUST** run `pnpm build` after making changes to `packages/engine` if you want to test those changes in `packages/gui` (as they import the built artifacts or use `tsx` which might require up-to-date types/builds depending on setup).
- The GUI has a separate backend server (`packages/gui/src/server.ts`) that needs to be running (`pnpm dev:backend` or `pnpm dev`) for the web UI to function.
- Remember to handle potential errors from LLM API calls gracefully.
